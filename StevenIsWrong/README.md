# Introduction

Here are a few things Steven has done in past conversations:

* Called me a Bernie Sanders supporter three times in front of everyone, even though I am not, when he is the one who voted for him twice...including in the election when Bernie was not actually running.
* Compared himself to Ken Thompson, and the invention of Unix to his own three-week sprint at Northrop Grumman
* Stated that his sole reason for disliking a book was that I liked it, which was such a dick move even Scott took issue
* Said that custard tarts are overrated

I could write a book about how these kinds of statements do not constitute intellectual discourse, and are less analogous to a well-executed chess game than to trying a fight a monkey that constantly lobs its own shit at you (in fact, if you look at my commit history, I already did). But let us just assume, for the sake of not wasting 50 pages arguing that Steven is a douchebag, that his last set of arguments were made in good faith.  I will address them in this regard:

* He has stated that the United States involvement in the Vietnam War is the reason the Soviet Union collapsed
* He has stated that without United States involvement, Israel would cease to exist and that its population of nine million would die
* He has stated that, had it not been for nuclear brinksmanship, the Soviet Union would have conquered Europe in its entirety 
* He has equated democracy with succession 
* He has claimed that Domino Theory was correct

Before I continue with rhetoric that plays tit-for-tat with the extremely douchey manner in which Steven laid down these arguments, let me lay down some bulleted facts:

* The cost of the Vietnam War for the United States was $843.63 billion in 2019 dollars and 58,200 American deaths[1].  The Soviet Union backed North Vietnam with $8 billion and zero soldiers.  There were 3000 Soviet Union advisors, so even if John Rambo killed all 3000 then that is still just 5% of American deaths [Calculator.exe]
* The cost of the Vietnam War for the Soviet Union was $50 billion, or $115 billion in 2019 dollars according to a CIA report [2]
* United States aid to Israel in recent years accounts for 3% of their budget and 1% of its GDP.  The United States aid to Israel's defense budget is 20% [3], which is nothing to scoff at, but Israel survived for decades without significant United States aid in worse circumstances (namely the two wars named below)

Can one formulate a reasonable argument that the collapse of the Soviet Union was primarily caused by an arms race with the United States, particularly in the costs of the Afghanistan War, which exacerbated an unstable economy that highlighted not just how tenuous the Soviet Union was in terms of military power, but in its oppressive state-controlled economy as well?  Can one make a case that Obama's handling of the situation in the Syria, especially when considering the horrific bombings and chemical attacks by the Syrians and (by extension/aid) Russians, was not aggressive enough?  Can one call the belief that the Middle East would have been better without United States military involvement naive, as if some utopia would spring up in our military's absence?  Absolutely.  But instead of doing that, it is apparently more productive to argue about whether Israel would collapse and that all of its people would die without United States involvement, even though Israel did not receive any financial aid from the United States until 1967 and triumphed in both the 1948 Palestine War and the Six Day War while the Americans refused to help [4].  Similarly nuanced and thoughtful, well-supported arguments could have been made about the Hamas Government in Gaza, or the massacres a triumphant communist Vietnam would have likely carried out against Catholics without the United States involvement in the Vietnam War, or that the soviets could have put a serious strain on resources and manpower if they had chosen to keep their hold on Europe in the time immediately following World War Two.  But no.  Nuance is for idiots.

The key thesis was that United States hegemony has saved lives, which could have been a compelling (albeit vague and impossible to prove) topic of discourse.  Maybe he could have opened with his take on foreign policy with regard to the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the second World War - instead I am going to have to argue that the Vietnam War is not the reason for their dissolution, an argument so blatantly wrong that I am not convinced it was made seriously but to piss me off.  He could have reflected on the tense conflict and proxy wars between the United States and Soviet Union superpowers, but instead I have to explain why the Soviet Union would not have completely conquered Europe and then carried out a Great Purge on its population.  Maybe he could have continued with his own historical perspective on China, from the dynasties to the rise of communism, and fluidly expanded on how their crimes and aggression led us to the most recent situation today - instead I am going to have to argue against Domino Theory.  Maybe he also could have touched on the complex situation in Israel, with its many sides and millenia long past, but instead I am going to have to argue that Israel would not cease to exist without United States involvement, and that its inhabitants would promptly die.  These are, perhaps, extremely complex topics that should be discussed thoughtfully and with research; but no, instead we are throwing around extremes without backing, supporting them with flimsy hypotheticals, and doing so in the audience of someone who already agreed.  If there is anything I have learned so far, it is that the way to bridge this country's divide is by laughing at opinions we disagree with as if they were the stupidest things we have ever heard, then sending them memes, pictures of their guns, and bullshit from the pol section of 4Chan.   This is the situation we are now in, so I may as well get started.

# The Vietnam War is not the reason the Soviet Union collapsed

The first, and by far stupidest, argument Steven has made is that the United States decision to spend 145 billion dollars (843 in 2019 dollars) on the Vietnam War while the Soviet Union spent 8 billion [5] is why the Soviet Union collapsed.  Actually, there are five primary reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union, many of which are related to Gorbachev (though he can hardly be blamed, in spite of an approval rating lower than that of Joseph Stalin).  Following the Soviet withdrawal in the Afghanistan War, the $2500 billion GDP had dropped to about $2.5 billion and the per capita income was just $8700 while that of the United States was $19,800 [6]. 

Gorbachev's policies perestroika and glasnot, meaning a mixed capitalist/communist economy and freedom of speech/press, were well-intentioned but backfired.  The Chernobyl Incident exposed lies in Soviet Union propaganda and, in Gorbachev's words, may have done more to dissolve the Soviet Union than anything else [7].  The Soviet Union was comprised of 15 nations, each with arguably incompatible cultures and varying religions, and nationalist movements in sattelite nations (most notably the Ukraine) caused unrest.  The military was reduced, an attempted coup against Gorbachev was carried out and failed, and Germany was re-unified at Reagen's urging.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves.  The argument, as Steven presented it, was that the Vietnam War caused the Soviet Union to collapse so that it could not conquer Europe.  The Vietnam War consisted of the infamous My Lai Massacre, in which Americans killed 504 unarmed civilians, but I suppose that is a pretty insignificant number.  The Vietnam War led to the deaths of 4 million Vietnamese civilians [8] and more than 50,000 Americans, many of whom were drafted...but I suppose those four million civilians may have died anyway after the French withdrew and Ho Chi Minh made his infamous independence speech with rhetoric taken directly from that of our founding fathers.  Martin Luther King, Jr. said:

"Even though they quoted the American Declaration of Independence in their own document of freedom, we refused to recognize them. Instead, we decided to support France in its reconquest of her former colony. Our government felt then that the Vietnamese people were not ready for independence, and we again fell victim to the deadly Western arrogance that has poisoned the international atmosphere for so long. With that tragic decision we rejected a revolutionary government seeking self-determination and a government that had been established not by China — for whom the Vietnamese have no great love — but by clearly indigenous forces that included some communists. For the peasants this new government meant real land reform, one of the most important needs in their lives."

^But his opinion hardly matters, am I right?  

I think this segues pretty well into the most problematic argument made thus far:

# Steven claimed that the beliefs/positions of the people in the nations we intervene in do not matter

Gosh, that title text was a mouthful.  I believe the direct quote was something like, "Why should we care what they think?  We might as well ask the people in Guantanamo Bay think.  They don't know what's best for them."
