# Introduction

Arguing with Steven is not like a well-executed chess match, but more like the act of trying to fight a monkey that constantly lobs wet chunks of his own shit at you.  The monkey is not using strategy.  The monkey is not planning out exactly how it will go about ruining your day.  No, the monkey throws shit, and if that doesn't annoy you then it will lob more shit. 

Among the extraordinarly stupid, ignorant, braindead arguments Steven has formulated, not so much out of genuine belief but for the sole purpose of pissing me off, Steven has:

* Stated that the United States involvement in the Vietman War is the reason the Soviet Union collapsed
* Compared himself to Ken Thompson and the invention of Unix to three weeks of himself working at Northrop Grumman
* Stated that without United States involvement, Israel would cease to exist
* Equated democracy with succession 
* Claimed that Domino Theory was correct

Some of these arguments actually sound legitimate, until you realize they are completely wrong and likely made up on the spot in order to push along some sort of argument that was already going nowhere.  Let me emphasize that these were not made in a good faith attempt to perpetuate actual discourse, but to make up knee-jerk patty cake bullshit with an audience of a single person who agreed with him for the primary purpose of laughing condescendingly. One may suggest that Gorbachev's decision to allow elections and democratize caused the collapse of the Soviet Union, which is a pretty good segue into the argument that a democratic election is the equivalent of allowing a town that disagrees with the United States government to succeed.  The Domino Theory may possess some merit, albeit completely incorrect merit overshadowed by the fact that the exact opposite took place, but that's not how these conversations go.  No, because of the level of stupidity we are now forced to grapple with, we're going to have to respond to the argument that without us, full confidence, Israel would not exist.  Maybe we should use nuance in how we analyze this.  Maybe we should do research.  Nah.  Screw it.  Let's read 16 pages of a book instead before derailing into some incoherent shitposting.

These arguments above, including a little dash of self-important delusion, are really only the tip of the iceberg that is talking to Steven.  In fact, his entire strategy for carrying out discussion can be summarized by opening meme, intermediate contradiction by vague hypothetical and unsupported fact, and closing statement of realizing nothing he just said actually makes sense.

 

He has also called me a Bernie Sanders supporter three times in front of everyone, even though I am not, when he is the one who voted for him twice...including in the election when Bernie was not actually running.  He has called custard tarts overrated.  He has said, and I quote, "I am just shitting on that book because Evan likes it" with regard to a meaningless self-help bookyou can buy on Kindle for $1.
