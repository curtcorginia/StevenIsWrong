# Introduction

Here are a few things Steven has done in past conversations:

* Called me a Bernie Sanders supporter three times in front of everyone, even though I am not, when he is the one who voted for him twice...including in the election when Bernie was not actually running.
* Compared himself to Ken Thompson, and the invention of Unix to his own three-week sprint at Northrop Grumman
* Stated that his sole reason for disliking a book was that I liked it, which was such a dick move even Scott took issue
* Said that custard tarts are overrated
* Has stated that the Domino Theory was correct

I could write a book about how these kinds of statements do not constitute intellectual discourse, and are less analogous to a well-executed chess game than to trying a fight a monkey that constantly lobs its own shit at you (in fact, if you look at my commit history, I already did). But let us just assume, for the sake of not wasting 50 pages arguing that Steven is a douche bag, that his last set of arguments were made in good faith.  We will address them in this regard:

* He has stated that the United States involvement in the Vietnam War is the reason the Soviet Union collapsed
* He has stated that without United States involvement, Israel would cease to exist and that its population of nine million would die
* He has stated that, had it not been for nuclear brinksmanship, the Soviet Union would have conquered Europe in its entirety 
* He has equated democracy with succession 
* He has claimed that Domino Theory was correct

Can one make a case that Obama's handling of the situation in the Syria, especially when considering the horrific bombings and chemical attacks by the Syrians and (by extension/aid) Russians, was not aggressive enough?  Can one call the belief that the Middle East would have been better without United States military involvement naive, as if some utopia would spring up in our military's absence?  Absolutely.  But instead of doing that, it is apparently more productive to argue about whether Israel would collapse and that all of its people would die without United States involvement, even though Israel did not receive any financial aid from the United States until 1967 and triumphed in both the 1948 Palestine War and the Six Day War while the Americans refused to help ["Six Day War, 1"].  Similarly nuanced and thoughtful, well-supported arguments could have been made about the Hamas Government in Gaza, or the massacres a triumphant communist Vietnam would have likely carried out against Catholics without the United States involvement in the Vietnam War, or that the soviets could have put a serious strain on resources and manpower if they had chosen to keep their hold on Europe in the time immediately following World War Two.  But no.  Nuance is for idiots.

The key thesis was that United States hegemony has saved lives, which could have been a compelling (albeit vague) topic of discourse.  Maybe he could have opened with his take on foreign policy with regard to the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the second World War - instead I am going to have to argue that the Vietnam War is not the reason for their dissolution, an argument so blatantly wrong that I am not convinced it was made seriously but to piss me off.  He could have reflected on the tense conflict and proxy wars between the United States and Soviet Union superpowers, but instead I have to explain why the Soviet Union would not have completely conquered Europe and then carried out a Great Purge on its population.  Maybe he could have continued with his own historical perspective on China, from the dynasties to the rise of communism, and fluidly expanded on how their crimes and aggression led us to the most recent situation today - instead I am going to have to argue against Domino Theory.  Maybe he also could have touched on the complex situation in Israel, with its many sides and millenia long past, but instead I am going to have to argue that Israel would not cease to exist without United States involvement, and that its inhabitants would promptly die.  These are, perhaps, extremely complex topics that should be discussed thoughtfully and with research; but no, instead we are throwing around extremes without backing, supporting them with flimsy hypotheticals, and doing so in the audience of someone who already agreed.  If there is anything I have learned so far, it is that the way to bridge this country's divide is by laughing at opinions we disagree with as if they were the stupidest things we have ever heard, then sending them memes, pictures of their guns, and bullshit from the pol section of 4Chan.   This is the situation we are now in, so I may as well get started.

# The Vietnam War is not the reason the Soviet Union collapsed

The first, and by far stupidest, argument Steven has made is that the United States decision to spend 145 billion dollars on the Vietnam War while the Soviet Union spent 8 billion [2] is why the Soviet Union collapsed.
